## resolve axios has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present 
Server-side solution: If you have control over the server-side code, you can modify the server to include the necessary CORS headers. Add the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header with the appropriate domain(s) or '*' (wildcard) value to allow requests from any origin. For example, in Node.js with Express, you can use the cors package to enable CORS easily.
